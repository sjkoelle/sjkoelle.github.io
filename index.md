style="float:right;width:404px;height:598px;"> I am a PhD candidate in the University of Washington Deparment of Statistics advised by Marina Meila. Recently, I have also been working with Stefan Mihalas at Allen Brain on modelling the neural connectome. Previously, I worked on stem-cell fate tracking in Cindy Dunbar's group at the National Institutes of Health, single-cell RNA-sequencing with Raphael Gottardo at Fred Hutch, interned at Amazon Supply Chain Optimization Technologies. I have a BA in Math from Columbia University.</p>

<p> My thesis research is on algorithms for parametric dimension reduction that give interpretability to learned representations. This work combines techniques from optimization, machine learning, differential geometry, and high-dimensional statistics.
We apply this methodology to data from quantum molecular dynamics and astronomy, but it is relevant to a broad range of fields.

I also do research on computational biology.</p>
