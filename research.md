My current research focus is development of meta-algorithms for interpretable dimension reduction, with an application to quantum molecular dynamics.  The main idea is to select interpretable functions for summarizing the data distribution. This is at the intersection of the data-driven discovery of governing laws of dynamical systems and interpretable machine learning research ecosystems.

I also have an interest in the intersection of gene editing, immunology, and stem cell biology. The unifying idea is statistification of single-cell phenotype and lineage analyses of complex biological processes. Much of this work was done in collaboration with Cindy Dunbar at the NIH, where I worked for two years prior to graduate school.
