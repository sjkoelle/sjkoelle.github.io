I was an National Institutes of Health IRTA fellow in Cindy Dunbar's lab. We worked on stem cell fate tracking using molecular barcoding in the rhesus macaque model. Uniquely labelled stem cells transplanted into the animal model give insights into proliferative behavior of particular clones. Development of inferential procedures for stem cell trees led me to attend grad school at the UW Statistics Department.
