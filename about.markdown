Hi! I am a 5th year PhD candidate in the University of Washington Deparment of Statistics. I work in Marina Meila's group. My thesis research is on meta-algorithms for interpretable unsupervised learning. I have an interest in stem cell biology, in particular cellular barcoding, and was a supply-chain optimization intern at Amazon.
